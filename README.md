# Capstone-Project-GIGIH-3.0

This project will assess whether various groups of Indonesians, classified by gender, economic activity, and disability status, earn wages that meet or exceed the minimum wage criteria. 
The study aims to offer valuable insights and recommendations to key stakeholders regarding overall earnings in Indonesia. 
These findings can be instrumental for stakeholders in reviewing and formulating regulations tailored to specific demographic groups, contributing to the advancement of Sustainable Development Goal 8A, which promotes decent work and economic growth.
